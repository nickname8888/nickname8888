### Hello there, I am Neeraj Nerkar! 

I work on research-driven machine learning projects, with a strong focus on deep learning for signals and structured data, including EEG-based seizure detection, time-series modeling, and computer vision. My interests lie in problems where data quality, modeling choices, and evaluation rigor directly impact outcomes.

Alongside research, I have hands-on experience turning models into scalable, production-ready systems, building data pipelines and ML workflows that hold up in real environments. I care deeply about mathematical clarity, reproducibility, and clean implementations.

This GitHub hosts applied ML research, experimental prototypes, and system-level projects that bridge theory and practice.
